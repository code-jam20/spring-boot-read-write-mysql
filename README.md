# Read Write MySQL Configuration using Spring Boot JPA
This repo shows how to set up separate read-write DB configurations using Spring Boot JPA libraries. It used MySQL Containers to test and have an entity with the below mapping.

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Kristy",
    "lastName": "Lowry",
    "department": "HR"
}
```
